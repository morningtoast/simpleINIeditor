#Simple INI Editor

Simple PHP-based front for editing INI files.

I needed a simple web interface to update INI files in another web app. This
editor has been left basic and unstyled as it is intended to be integrated with
your existing code. It can be used as-is but I would suggest making a lot
additions to make it secure, pretty, etc.

## Requirements
* jQuery
* Mustache
* PHP 5.2+


## Todo
